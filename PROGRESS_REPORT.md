- **Impact**: Non-critical, system remains functional
- **Status**: Under investigation
- **Workaround**: System operates normally despite test failure

#### 2. Memory Usage Spikes (Minor)
- **Issue**: Occasional memory spikes during large document processing
- **Trigger**: Documents > 50MB or > 100,000 tokens
- **Impact**: Temporary performance degradation
- **Workaround**: Process documents in smaller batches (< 25MB)
- **Status**: Optimization in progress

### Potential Issues (Monitoring Required)

#### 1. Concurrent Access Bottlenecks
- **Risk**: High concurrent load may cause database connection issues
- **Mitigation**: Connection pooling implemented (max 20 connections)
- **Monitoring**: Database connection metrics and response times
- **Threshold**: > 15 concurrent users may experience delays

#### 2. Token Limit Exceeded
- **Risk**: Large context may exceed LLM token limits
- **Mitigation**: Context optimization and intelligent truncation
- **Monitoring**: Context size metrics and truncation frequency
- **Threshold**: Contexts > 8000 tokens automatically optimized

#### 3. Knowledge Graph Performance
- **Risk**: Large knowledge graphs may slow query performance
- **Mitigation**: Graph indexing and query optimization
- **Monitoring**: Neo4j query performance metrics
- **Threshold**: Queries > 500ms flagged for optimization
