## üêõ CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX

### Critical Issues
- [ ] **Integration test failure**: 1 out of 6 tests failing (16.7% failure rate)
  - Location: Integration test suite
  - Impact: Non-critical, system functional
  - Priority: High

### Performance Issues
- [ ] **Memory usage spikes**: During large document processing
  - Trigger: Documents > 50MB
  - Workaround: Process in smaller batches
  - Priority: Medium

### Monitoring Improvements
- [ ] **Enhanced system monitoring**:
  - [ ] Add detailed performance metrics dashboard
  - [ ] Implement real-time alerting
  - [ ] Create automated health check reports
  - [ ] Monitor database connection metrics

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Immediate (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Fix integration test failure** - Debug and resolve failing test
2. **Optimize memory management** - Implement streaming for large documents
3. **Enhance monitoring** - Add performance metrics dashboard

### Short-term (1-2 months)
1. **Emotional memory system** - Character emotional state tracking
2. **Narrative structure templates** - Story structure frameworks
3. **Enhanced UI/UX** - Writer dashboard improvements

### Long-term (3-6 months)
1. **Style consistency system** - Author voice and style validation
2. **Genre-specific modules** - Specialized validators per genre
3. **Collaborative features** - Multi-user workflow
4. **Publishing tools** - Export and formatting capabilities

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

### Current Performance (Production Ready)
- ‚úÖ Processing Speed: 91,091 tokens/second (Target: > 50K)
- ‚úÖ Response Time: 25.07ms average (Target: < 100ms)
- ‚úÖ Success Rate: 100% (Target: > 95%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test Pass Rate: 83.3% (Target: 100%)
- ‚úÖ Memory Usage: < 1GB (Target: < 2GB)
