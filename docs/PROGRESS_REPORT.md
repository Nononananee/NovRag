## Progress Report

### Phase 2 Completion
- All tests for the emotional memory system have passed with 100% success rate.
- Implemented and verified features include emotional analysis storage, consistency validation, and error handling.

### Update: Emotional Memory System & Validator Enhancements (Phase 2 - Completed)
- **Emotional Memory System Integration:**
    - Database retrieval functions for emotional states and arcs have been implemented in `agent/db_utils.py`.
    - The `IntegratedNovelMemorySystem` now actively fetches and incorporates emotional context into the LLM's prompt, ensuring emotional consistency in generated content.
- **Enhanced Emotional Consistency Validator:**
    - A new, sophisticated `emotional_consistency_validator` has been added to `agent/consistency_validators_fixed.py`.
    - This validator uses nuanced transition rules, considers temporal aspects, and provides actionable suggestions for emotional shifts.
- **Critical Bug Fix in `fact_check_validator`:**
    - The logic in `fact_check_validator` has been corrected to accurately identify contradictions with established facts, rather than just matches.

### Next Steps: Phase 3
- Proceed to Phase 3 development as planned.
- Focus on integration of RAG system components and further testing.
